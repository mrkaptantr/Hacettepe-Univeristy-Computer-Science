# Go-Py Game
# 29.11.2019 - Friday

# Very Important Note: I also add these functions, which are not in PDF or piazza:
# (1) Round Draw: If no winners, code crash. But now when all inputs are filled by X and O and if there is no winners
# it will print a message like "Round draw no winners" and end game without error(s).
# (2) Size Of Board: If size of board is negative, 0, 1 or 2 code crash. But now it'll only print a error message and
# ask size of board again.
# (3) Colorful print functions, for example error messages are red.

# Also it works with Python 3.

\u001b[32m-What is GoPy Board Game?
\u001b[34mThis game is a board game for two players who take 
turns in putting black and white stones on the board. 
Of course Player 1 is [X] and Player 2 is [O].
\u001b[32m-What's Our Goal? How To Win? 
\u001b[34mEach playersâ€™ goal is to create an unbroken row of their 
letter horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
Good luck :) \u001b[32m
