Grade: 90/100

Strengths:
- It works well.

Deficiencies:
- Execution is slow since it computes distances between points in each function call. With using a distance matrix, execution time can be reduced dramatically.
- The results obtained with parameter changes are not fully compatible with the theoretically expected results. (It may be caused from code or dataset)
