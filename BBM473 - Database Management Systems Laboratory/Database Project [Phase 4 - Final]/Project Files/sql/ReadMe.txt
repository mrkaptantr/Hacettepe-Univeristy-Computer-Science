About Database: 
1- Database backup is available in different 2 formats.

2- There are a few weird rows in database, which were added during testing.

Just a small notes about application:

1- A .jar file is added to resources but if you won't be able to execute 
it i also added ECommerceManagementSystem file which is project's source files.

2- All of operations on each of interfaces (and tables) are already checked.
